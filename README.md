# Keylogger-cybersecurityaicte
A keylogger is a type of software or hardware device that records keystrokes on a computer without the user's knowledge. In Python, you can create a basic keylogger using various modules and techniques. However, it's important to note that using keyloggers without proper authorization is illegal and a breach of privacy. This description is provided for educational purposes only.

Here's a high-level overview of how you could create a basic keylogger using Python:

1.Import the necessary modules: You'll need to import the pynput module, which provides functionality to monitor and control input devices such as keyboards and mice.

2.Create a listener: Use the pynput.keyboard module to create a keyboard listener that will capture the keystrokes. You can define a callback function that will be triggered each time a key is pressed.

3.Capture and store keystrokes: Within the callback function, you can capture the pressed key and store it in a file or database. You may want to timestamp each keystroke and include additional information such as the active application or window.

4.Run the keylogger: Start the keyboard listener to begin capturing the keystrokes. You can also run the keylogger as a background process or hide it from the user.

5.Optional: Implement advanced features: You can enhance the keylogger by adding features such as sending captured data via email or encrypting the logged information for increased security.

It's important to be aware that using keyloggers on someone else's computer without their explicit consent is a violation of privacy and may be illegal. Make sure to use this knowledge responsibly and only in compliance with applicable laws and ethical guidelines.
